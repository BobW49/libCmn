/*
 * Program
 *			An Unordered Tree of NodeLinks (NodeTree)
 * Purpose
 *          This object provides for an un-ordered tree of nodes.
 *          Un-ordered means that the tree nodes are not in order
 *          by name (ie key). They are in order by placement.
 *
 *          This method of representation is called "The Binary
 *          Tree Representation of Trees", section 2.3.2 of
 *          "Fundamental Algorithms" (3rd Ed), Donald Knuth.
 *
 * Remarks
 *  1.      This tree uses object, NodeLink, not Node, because it
 *          uses the links provided by NodeLink rather than having
 *          them be internal.
 *  2,      The left pointer of nodeEntry is used for nextSibling
 *          and the right index for nextChild.
 *  3.      By using NodeNew() and NodeLinkChild() together, one
 *          can build a tree from the bottom up which is consist-
 *          ent with recursive descent parsing. In this case, you
 *          must add the root first before using NodeNew() and
 *          NodeLinkChild().
 *
 * History
 *  08/04/2015  Generated
 *  09/19/2016  Added NodeNew(), NodeLinkChild(), and other functions
 *              that allowed the internal structure of the tree to
 *              be separate from the Node.
 *  02/18/2018  Changed traversals which were based on binary trees to
 *              the appropriate scan for multi-way trees. See Knuth,
 *              pg 337.  Also, changed node's child and sibling indices
 *              to left and right indices respectively which mirrors
 *              Knuth's definition.
 *  07/01/2018  Changed base node to nodeLink for all the nodes of the
 *              tree.
 *  12/13/2018  Removed the inorder traversal of the tree. See p. 336
 *              of "Fundamental Algorithms", Donald Knuth, 3rd Edition.
