 * Program
 *			POSIX Thread Object (psxThread)
 * Purpose
 *          This class tries to provide a Posix-like thread within
 *          a process for several operating systems. Thus, it provides
 *          a consistent interface for those operating systems.
 *          It is primarily designed to manage threads which do a 
 *          small amount of work and then relinquish control in a
 *          loop.  However, it can be used for single process type
 *          threads as well.  Also, the thread's actual execution
 *          code can be changed after its creation allowing the 
 *          thread to perform a multitude of purposes.
 *
 *          A wait which defaults to 100ms is added to the end of
 *          each execution cycle of the execution cycle. This can
 *          be over-ridden with the Wait property or the CalcWait
 *          property.  CalcWait allows the wait time to be dynamically
 *          calculated each time.
 *
 * Remarks
 *	1.      We will call the thread created by this object, "worker"
 *          thread.
