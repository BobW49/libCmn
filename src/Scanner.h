/*
 * Program
 *			Generic String Scanner (Scanner)
 * Purpose
 *			This object provides a generic scanner which is based
 *          on a builtin static W32StrC.  Originally, it was a set
 *          of disjoint routines that scanned various types of
 *          items which were used mostly to scan program command
 *          lines. They have been updated to be more cohesive and
 *          more general in nature.
 *
 *          Most of the methods will first scan off white-space
 *          before beginning their specific scan.
 * Remarks
 *  1.      OBJ_FLAG_USER1 is used by this object.
 *  2.      obj's Misc fields are used by this object.
 *  3.      The JSON support does not save or restore either of the
 *          properties, Object1 and Object2.
 *
 * History
 *  07/26/2018 Generated
 *	03/04/2020 Regenerated
 *  04/10/2022 Added properties, Object1 and Object2.

    /*!
     Scan a string from the input which is terminated by comma or NUL. This
     is equivalent to a comma delimited file type scan. The string may be
     quoted or not.  Whitespace will be absorbed into the string if not
     quoted. Leading whitespace will not be absorbed into the string.
     If strings need to contain spaces, they must be surrounded
     by quotes, either single or double.  Quoted strings may also
     contain the special sequences which will be translated into
     specific characters such as:

     of the leading quote, either single or double. For a non-quoted
     string, the scan is terminated by a comma (',') or line ter-
     minator (NUL). Note that this is a slightly different scan
