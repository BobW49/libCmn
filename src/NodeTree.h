/*
 * Program
 *          An Unordered Tree of Nodes (NodeTree)
 * Purpose
 *          This object provides for an un-ordered tree of nodes.
 *          Un-ordered means that the tree nodes are not in order
 *          by name (ie key). They are in order by placement.
 *
 *          This method of representation is called "The Binary
 *          Tree Representation of Trees", section 2.3.2 of
 *          "Fundamental Algorithms" (3rd Ed), Donald Knuth.
 *
 *          This object fully supports Tree and Forest management.
 *          Additional trees may be added simply by providing 0
 *          as the parent on addition to this object.
 *
 *          Depth-First-Search and Breadth-First-Search are sup-
 *          ported. In the case of an array of Nodes being returned,
 *          those arrays can be reversed to get the Reverse traversal
 *          of the Tree.
 *
 * Remarks
 *  1.      This object uses OBJ_FLAG_USER1.
 *  2.      Because this implementation uses a parent, child
 *          and sibling pointers, it does support shared sub-
 *          trees (since there is only 1 parent pointer).
 *  3,      The left pointer of the unordered binary tree is
 *          for the child pointer and the right pointer is used
 *          for the next Sibling.  All pointers are numeric
 *          indices starting from 1. To traverse the children,
 *          you start with the child (head) index and then traverse
 *          that node's siblings.
 *  4.      By using NodeNew() and NodeLinkChild() together, one
 *          can build a tree from the bottom up which is consist-
 *          ent with recursive descent parsing. In this case, you
 *          must add the root first before using NodeNew() and
 *          NodeLinkChild().
 *
 * History
 *  08/04/2015  Generated
 *  09/19/2016  Added NodeNew(), NodeLinkChild(), and other functions
 *              that allowed the internal structure of the tree to
 *              be separate from the Node.
 *  02/18/2018  Changed traversals which were based on binary trees to
 *              the appropriate scan for multi-way trees. See Knuth,
 *              pg 337.  Also, changed node's child and sibling indices
 *              to left and right indices respectively which mirrors
 *              Knuth's definition.
 *  07/01/2018  Changed base node to nodeLink for all the nodes of the
 *              tree.
 *  12/13/2018  Removed the inorder traversal of the tree. See p. 336
 *              of "Fundamental Algorithms", Donald Knuth, 3rd Edition.
 *  01/10/2020  Regenerated
 *  11/26/2021  Regenerated and changed to no longer require NodeLink.
 *              The node linkage is internal to the tree now. This
 *              a Node or its derivitive to be used.
 *  05/28/2022  Changed to support Node creation from inheriting trees
 *              using NodeTree_NodeNewUTF8() using other than Node.
 *  06/12/2022  Added support for double linked list being used for
 *              siblings and children to facilitate appending lots
 *              of children/siblings and traversals.
 *  07/07/2022  Changed Pre and Post Traversals to support internal
 *              searches which required more information than external
 *              traversals.
