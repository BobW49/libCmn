 * Program
 *			Look-Ahead Interface (laInterface)
 * Purpose
 *          The Look-Ahead Interface providing a common interface for
 *          objects that need to do look-ahead system for parsing.
 *
 *          An object would provide this interface after it has
 *          opened the file source.The default size is 80 bytes.
 *          It is assumed that data
 *          is only in columns 1 - 71. Column 72 is a continuation
 *          indicator with a default continuation column of 16.
 *          Columns 73 - 80 are assumed to be sequence numbers
 *          which are not checked.
 *
 *          All memory needed is gotten from the operating system
 *          to minimize impact on C's Heap.
 *
 *          An associated LRU buffering mechanism is utilized in
 *          these routines.
 *
 * Remarks
 *	1.      Internally, lines may be 80-82 characters. When a
 *          dataset is opened, it will be scanned at bytes 80
 *          and 81 to determine if there are \r or \n characters
 *          after the 80 bytes of data.
