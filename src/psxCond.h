/*
 * Program
 *			Posix Condition Variable (psxCond)
 * Purpose
 *			To wait for a condition to become true, a thread can make
 *          use of what is known as a condition variable. A condition 
 *          variable is an explicit queue that threads can put them-
 *          selves on when some state of execution (i.e., some condition)
 *          is not as desired (by waiting on the condition); some other 
 *          thread, when it changes said state, can then wake one (or 
 *          more) of those waiting threads and thus allow them to continue
 *          (by signaling on the condition).
 *
 *          A condition variable has two operations associated with it: 
 *          wait() and signal(). The wait() call is executed when a thread
 *          wishes to put itself to sleep; the signal() call is executed 
 *          when a thread has changed something in the program and thus 
 *          wants to wake a sleeping thread waiting on this condition.
 *
 *          The wait() method can have spurious wake ups. So, it is
 *          imperative that the condition that is being waited for
 *          is checked after each wake up and the wait re-entered if
 *          the conditions have not been met.
 *
 * Remarks
 *	1.      None for now
