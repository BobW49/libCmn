 * Program
 *			Least Recently Used Buffering (lru)
 * Purpose
 *			This object provides a standardized way of handling
 *          Least Recently Used Buffering.
 *
 *          These routines intercept the normal read/write process.
 *          First, the using object must give this object the physical
 *          read and/or write routines. Second, it must then call
 *          the routines provided by this object which will utilize
 *          the LRU buffering only calling the physical routines
 *          when physical reads or writes must be performed.
 *
 *          The logical sector number is simply used to distinguish
 *          the buffers by hashing it and otherwise is simply passed
 *          on as is to the physical read/write routines.
 *
 *          Optionally, you can load the buffers with reads or locks
 *          without buffer pointers and then get the buffer address
 *          using FindBuffer().  Be aware that if you did not lock
 *          the buffer, it might be re-used while you have access to
 *          it.  Lock()/Unlock() pairs are the safest way to go.
 *
 * Remarks
 *	1.      If the delayed-writes property is set, writing to the file
 *          is only done when a buffer is needed for re-use or the \
 *          system is being shutdown.  Writes are accumulated in memory
 *          until then minimizing I/O.
 *
 * History
 *	10/21/2016  Generated
 *  06/07/2023  Fixed so that objects attached to buffers would be
 *              released upon this object being released.
