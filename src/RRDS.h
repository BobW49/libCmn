/*
 * Program
 *          Relative Record Dataset (ie Fixed size records indexed
 *          by record number) (RRDS)
 * Purpose
 *          The RRDS routines provide Record I/O functions for a
 *          dataset/file.  An RRDS dataset/file consists of zero
 *          or more fixed length records as used on large IBM
 *          mainframes.
 *
 *          Optionally, records can be defined to be terminated
 *          by one of several terminaltors. See RRDS_RCD_TRMS
 *          below. The more normal usage is without terminators
 *          which extend the length of the record and to treat the
 *          record as blocks of data that can be subdivided as
 *          needed into data records.
 *
 *          The default size is 80 bytes. Line endings may not exist
 *          or they can be <cr>, <cr><lf>, <lf> or <lf><cr>. This
 *          may be set for Create() and Open() will check for it.
 *          IBM assumed that data in 80 column records used only
 *          columns 1 - 71 for data. Column 72 was a continuation
 *          indicator with a default continuation column of 16 on
 *          the following record. Columns 73 - 80 were assumed to
 *          be sequence numbers which are not checked. Checking is
 *          not performed for continuation nor for sequence numbers.
 *
 *          An associated LRU buffering mechanism is utilized in
 *          these routines if the dataset is defined as disk based.
 *
 *          An optional area at the beginning of the file can be
 *          reserved for control information if needed.  This
 *          reserve size sets the size of the area and the offset
 *          into the file of the first record.  This size must
 *          be specified before an create() or open().
 *
 * Remarks
 *    1.    If the default record size is used, the lines may be
 *          80-82 characters. When a dataset is opened, it will
 *          be scanned at bytes 81 and 82 to determine if there
 *          are \r, \n, \r\n or \n\r characters after the 80
 *          bytes of data.
 *    2.    Files are not maintained for endian-ness. So, they
 *          should only be used on 1 machine.
 *
 * History
 *  01/05/2019 Generated
 *  07/10/2021 Regenerated and modified to include memory based
 *              files with this object.
 *  06/11/2023 Fixed several problems with the reserved area.
