/*
 * Program
 *			Hash Table of Objects (ObjHash)
 * Purpose
 *          This object provides a standardized way of handling
 *          a Hash table for objects. The objects must support
 *          the compare() and hash() functions in their object
 *          vtbl. Since this is how the objects are looked at,
 *          this table has no knowledge of a key and objects
 *          must always be suppied for searches, deletions, etc.
 *
 *          The hash chains are manipulated like a push down
 *          stack with the latest addition being the closest
 *          to the head of the chain. So, if duplicate entries
 *          are allowed (see duplicates property), the
 *          lastest addition of that name will be the first
 *          to be found.
 *
 *          Entries are now added to the Hash chains and to
 *          Scope chains.  The default Scope level is 0. Scopes
 *          are a push-down stack. When a Scope is popped,
 *          all of its entries are removed from the table.
 *          ScopeOpen() pushes a new Scope level. ScopeClose()
 *          pops the scope level.
 *
 * Remarks
 *    1.    The objects added to this table must support the
 *          compare() and hash() methods. The compare() method
 *          must be able to compare its object against any
 *          other object in the table.  These methods are
 *          part of the common VTBL for each object, and must
 *          be implemented.
 *
 * History
 *  10/24/2015  Generated
 *  01/31/2018  Added the ability to have duplicate symbols
 *	02/02/2020  Regenerated and upgraded json
 *  12/16/2021  Added Scope levels.
